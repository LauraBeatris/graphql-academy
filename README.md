# GraphQL Academy

Simple GraphQL API to be used as a guidance from the topics covered on my workshop called "GraphQL Academy"

### Technologies 
The goal of this workshop is not to suggest/advocate for specific GraphQL libraries, thus don't feel obliged of choosing
the same dependencies from this repo as the choices for your project 

However, you can find the reasoning behind by choices [in this pull request](https://github.com/LauraBeatris/graphql-academy/pull/1)
